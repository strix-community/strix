## Prelude

Strix is an open-source community platform primarily focused around Garry's Mod. Strix is built with Laravel, Tailwind, Livewire, and AlpineJS. Designed with developers AND end-users in mind. Strix includes a configurable index, forums, and profile page with more to come. Strix is currently in pre-alpha and does NOT have a current release date.

<alert type="info">
Strix is built natively with Laravel and attempts to follow any and all conventions that come with it. Strix is tightly coupled with Laravel and has no plans to decouple from it.

Before we dive into getting started with Strix, we'd like to make it clear that Strix is designed to run on your own web server. You will need access to your server in order to run and Strix. That being said, it IS possible to use this on shared web servers, or better said, servers you do not have root access to.

You are also expected to understand and act out instructions from the documentation to use Strix. Support is not guaranteed for users who have never ran commands in a terminal before. If you expect to be able to install this with have never touched a terminal please read or watch tutorials to obtain the basics and come back later.

You'll notice that the Strix repo is rather bare. This is intentional, the base functionality of strix is located [in the core](https://github.com/strix-community/core) as a package that is imported. Strix is specifically designed to have the developer or end-user configure and build on-top of. Giving them the freedom to use Strix as a foundation, regardless of it being marketed as an all-in-one community platform solution.
